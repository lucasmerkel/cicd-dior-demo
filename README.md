# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide

## Build and Deploy to BTP 
- run `npm install` 
- then run `mbt build` 
- run `cf login -a <API endpoint of your subaccount --> see subaccount overview page>`
- finally run `cf deploy mta_archives/dior_sample_OPEN_1.0.0.mtar`

## Next Steps

- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch` 
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)
- Start adding content, for example, a [db/schema.cds](db/schema.cds).
